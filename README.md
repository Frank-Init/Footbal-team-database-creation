# Football Team Database Project

This SQL project involves the creation of a database named "Football Team" to manage player information, player abilities, and financial data related to a football team. The project includes the creation of three tables and the establishment of relationships between them using primary keys.

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:

1. **Player Info**: Contains information about each player, including player ID, name, position, age, nationality, etc.

2. **Player Ability**: Stores data regarding the abilities and skills of each player, such as passing, shooting, dribbling, defending, etc. 

3. **Financial Info**: Stores financial data related to the football team, including player salaries, transfer fees, contract durations, etc.

Relationships between the tables are established using primary keys, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## Data Population

The tables are populated with sample data using the `INSERT INTO` syntax. Sample records are inserted into each table to demonstrate the functionality of the database.

## Basic DML Operations

Basic Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations are performed on the database, including:

- Retrieving player information
- Updating player abilities
- Adding new players
- Deleting outdated financial records
- Querying data to generate insights and reports

## Files Included

- `football_team_database.sql`: SQL script containing the database schema, table creation statements, data insertion queries, and sample DML operations.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. **Database Creation**: Execute the `football_team_database.sql` script in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, etc.) to create the database and tables.
2. **Data Population**: Run the provided `INSERT INTO` queries to populate the tables with sample data.
3. **Perform DML Operations**: Use SQL queries to perform basic data manipulation operations on the database, as described in the project.
